When a users password has been changed on the Active Directory, you can use this procedure to remove the user from FileVault and re-add it with his new password.

sudo fdesetup remove -user username
sudo fdesetup add -usertoadd username
Enter the user name: adminusername
Enter the password for user 'adminusername':
Enter the password for the added user 'username':

Where username is the username of the user you want to remove and re-add.
And adminusername is the username of an administrative user.
